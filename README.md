Have you ever wondered about the mechanism behind your language translation tools and how these tools translate thousands of languages with great precision? Or even your grammar correction tools?

Personally, I have been puzzled by how all of this works. Well, the magic behind this incredible feat lies in one branch of artificial intelligence called **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. NLP is applied to many areas of our lives as long as they involve languages.
In this article, you will gain an understanding of NLP and how it can be applied to language detection.

<h2 id="topic1">What is NLP?</h2>

Before you delve into the essence of NLP, understand that natural language encompasses the methods humans use to communicate with one another, including both written and spoken forms.

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves programming computers to comprehend, process, and analyse human natural language data.
Unlike other artificial intelligence problems that involve tabular and image data, NLP typically deals with training data in the form of text and audio. In most cases, the goal is to classify and analyse strings of text.
