Have you ever wondered about the mechanism behind your language translation tools and how these tools translate thousands of languages with great precision? Or even your grammar correction tools? 

Personally, I have been puzzled by how all of this works. Well, the magic behind this incredible feat lies in one branch of artificial intelligence called **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. NLP is applied to many areas of our lives as long as they involve languages.
In this article, you will gain an understanding of NLP and how it can be applied to language detection.

<h2 id="topic1">What is NLP?</h2>

Before you delve into the essence of NLP, understand that natural language encompasses the methods humans use to communicate with one another, including both written and spoken forms.

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves programming computers to comprehend, process, and analyse human natural language data.
Unlike other artificial intelligence problems that involve tabular and image data, NLP typically deals with training data in the form of text and audio. In most cases, the goal is to classify and analyse strings of text.

<h2 id="topic2">Techniques Used in NLP</h2>

Natural Language Processing encompasses a wide range of techniques and methods to process and analyse human language data. Here are some of the key techniques and approaches used in NLP:

 ### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text or a sequence of characters into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are typically words, subwords, or even individual characters, depending on the specific use case. Tokenization is a fundamental step in NLP, and it serves in the feature extraction process of NLP tasks because text data needs to be transformed into a numerical format that machine learning models can process. Tokens serve as the basic features for these models. By tokenizing text, you convert it into a format suitable for feature extraction.
Here is how to perform tokenization:
```
def tokenize_text(text):
    """Tokenize a text into words using whitespace as a delimiter."""
    tokens = text.split()
    return tokens

text = "This is an example sentence for tokenization."
tokens = tokenize_text(text)
print(tokens 
```
Result:

### Bag Of Words
The 'Bag of Words' (BoW) is a common technique used in NLP. It represents text data as a collection of individual words or tokens, disregarding their order or structure within the text. BoW is a fundamental method for feature extraction from text data, making it suitable for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and document retrieval.

To implement BoW, you can use Scikit-Learn's CountVectorizer, which is a powerful tool for converting a collection of text documents into a matrix of word counts. Here's an example of how to use CountVectorizer to implement BoW in Python:
```
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Sample text data
corpus = [
    'This is the first document.',
    'This document is the second document.',
    'And this is the third one.',
    'Is this the first document?',
]

# Create an instance of CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus to create the BoW representation
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Get the vocabulary (unique words)
vocab = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# Convert the BoW representation to a dense array for readability
dense_array = X.toarray()

# Display the BoW representation
print("BoW representation:")
print(dense_array)

# Display the vocabulary
print("Vocabulary:")
print(vocab)
```
